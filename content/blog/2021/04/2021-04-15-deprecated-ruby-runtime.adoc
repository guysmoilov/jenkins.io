https://github.com/jenkinsci/ruby-runtime-plugin/commit/d368b087fadb3282c9b537f0fa6d9a150b080c73[10 years ago, ruby-runtime was first released]. It was an experiment to let
plugins to be written in ruby but still get integrated into the main
java Jenkins process.

Over the years though, the experiment has stopped being maintained, the
dozen or so plugins that use it take a lot of user effort to make work,
and the Jenkins ruby runtime does not support Java 11.
Specifically the last few years have been really hard on the Jenkins
core developers, as they still have to maintain all the hacks and
processes to keep the ruby runtime barely working.

One month from now, May 15th, 2021, the Jenkins update center will stop distributing
ruby-runtime and its https://plugins.jenkins.io/ruby-runtime/#dependencies[associated plugins].

== What does this mean for you?

If you are one of the few users who are using the following plugins. The
only change will come for new installs. Suspended plugins can stay
installed, but can not be newly installed without manually downloading
releases.

The lists below provide additional information about the most popular plugins based on the Ruby runtime.
Please plan your transition away from these plugins.
They will be removed from the update center May 15, 2021.
