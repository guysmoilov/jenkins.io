Approximately 
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ruby-runtime-plugin/commit/d368b087fadb3282c9b537f0fa6d9a150b080c73[10 years ago, ruby-runtime was first released]. It was an experiment to let
plugins to be written in ruby but still get integrated into the main
java Jenkins process.

Over the years though, the experiment has stopped being maintained, the
dozen or so plugins that use it take a lot of user effort to make work,
and the Jenkins ruby runtime does not support Java 11.
Specifically the last few years have been really hard on the Jenkins
core developers, as they still have to maintain all the hacks and
processes to keep the ruby runtime barely working.

One month from now, May 15th, 2021, the Jenkins update center will stop distributing
ruby-runtime and its https://plugins.jenkins.io/ruby-runtime/#dependencies[associated plugins].

== Suggested Workarounds

=== Gitlab-hook

* Recommendation is to switch to gitlab and gitlab-branch-source, which
not only has new features, but doesn't have large unaddressed security
issues

=== rvm

=== pry

=== Cucumber

* Writer recommends using cucumber bundled with ruby app, and output in
a junit format, then using the junit plugin process the results
