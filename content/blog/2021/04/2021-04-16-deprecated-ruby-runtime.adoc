Approximately
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ruby-runtime-plugin/commit/d368b087fadb3282c9b537f0fa6d9a150b080c73[10 years ago, ruby-runtime was first released]. It was an experiment to let
plugins to be written in ruby but still get integrated into the main
Java Virtual Machine runtime with help of link:https://www.jruby.org/[JRuby].

Over the years though, the experiment has stopped being maintained, the
dozen or so plugins that use it take a lot of user effort to make work,
and the Jenkins ruby runtime does not support Java 11.
Specifically the last few years have been really hard on the Jenkins
core developers, as they still have to maintain all the hacks and
processes to keep the ruby runtime barely working.

One month from now, May 15th, 2021, the link:https://updates.jenkins.io/[default Jenkins update center] will stop distributing
ruby-runtime and its https://plugins.jenkins.io/ruby-runtime/#dependencies[associated plugins].

== What does this mean for you?

If you are one of the few users who are using the following plugins. The
only change will come for new installs. Suspended plugins will stay
installed, but can not be newly installed without manually downloading
releases.

The lists below provide additional information about the most popular plugins based on the Ruby runtime.
Please plan your transition away from these plugins.
They will be removed from the update center May 15, 2021.

== Acknowledgements

We would like to thank all contributors and maintainers who contributed to the Ruby Runtime based plugins.
We also thank those who participated in development of new plugins replacing the functionality. 
These contributors helped millions of Jenkins users while the ecosystem was supported over the past 10 years,
and it is not taken for granted.
Now we need to move on so that we can keep expanding the Jenkins architecture and developers tools.
We invite all contributors to participate in this effort and to help us to migrate the plugins to supported JVM-based platforms for plugins.

== My instance is affected, what to do next?

If you do not use the affected plugins, the recommendation is to remove them.
Otherwise, it is recommended to start migration out of the plugins to alternatives providing similar functionality.

Not all plugins have alternatives.
At the moment the Jenkins core team does not plan providing a replacement, but any contributions are welcome.
If you depend on the functionality,
we recommend reaching out to the community in the link:/mailing-lists/[developer mailing list] so that 
you can coordinate the replacement with other affected users.
