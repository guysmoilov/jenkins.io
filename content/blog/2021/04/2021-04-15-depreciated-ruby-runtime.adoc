Approximately [10 years ago, ruby-runtime was first released](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ruby-runtime-plugin/commit/d368b087fadb3282c9b537f0fa6d9a150b080c73). It was an experiment to let plugins to be written in ruby but still get integrated into the main java jenkins process.

Over the years though, the experiment has stopped being maintained, the dozen or so plugins that use it, take a lot of user effort to make work. Specifically the last few years have been really hard on the Jenkins core developers, as they still have to maintain all the hacks and processes to keep the ruby runtime barely working.

So in one month from now, May 15th, 2021, we will stop distributing ruby-runtime and its [associated plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ruby-runtime/#dependencies) in the update center.

### What does this mean for you?

If your one of the few users who are using the following plugins. The only change will come for new installs. Suspended plugins can stay installed, but can not be newly installed without manually downloading releases.

### Suggested Workarounds

#### Gitlab-hook

* Recommendation is to switch to gitlab and gitlab-branch-source, which not only has new features, but doesn't have large unaddressed security issues

#### rvm
#### pry


#### Cucumber

* Writer recommends using cucumber bundled with ruby app, and output in a junit format, then using the junit plugin process the results
